This is a simple WHOIS HTTP server written in `Go` that runs on AppEngine. You can use this server to build your very own WHOIS server for FREE (except for AppEngine costs of course which are very light). It has no external dependencies and needs no database updates like other solutions. The information comes down from the AppEngine server via request headers. It's not entirely accurate information but suitable for non-critical use.

For more advanced information and accurate details I suggest you try a premium service such as [Infoip](https://infoip.io).
